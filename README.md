The fundamental thing that will make this good or not is the word list. 

I am using an abridged version of the Crossword Nexus Word List, cropped to 3, 4, and 5-letter words. 

https://crosswordnexus.com/downloads/wordlist.txt.zip

It only does full-matrixes of 3x3 4x4 and 5x5. It simply picks random words from the word list for across values, then checks the resulting down values against the same list.
